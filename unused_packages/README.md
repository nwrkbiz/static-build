Symlinking ../packages/GENERAL.mk into this directory allows you to manually build and tinker with these packages.

Working with at least some cpu architectures:

* ffmpeg
* sdb
* scrcpy (if android sdk is installed)
* lwm

Other packages are not working due to lacking dependencies or have broken build commands.
